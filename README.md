# HL7 EU Common Cancer Model
## Concept Model and Glossary for Common Cancer Model Project

The initial OWL 2 model was generated from [European Cancer Common Conceptual Model v2](https://confluence.hl7.org/download/attachments/281282385/CancerLogicalModel_20250414_Rev.png?version=1&modificationDate=1744961792994&api=v2) with Claude's support. 
This model was imported into MacDraw UML 2024x with the Cameo Concept Model plugin. The imported model was revised, integrated, and extended with the [glossary](https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/HEU/pages/281282385/Cancer+Common+Model+Project+Edition+1)  
From this UML model, a set of arifacts was generated 

* EuropeanCancerModel-v02.rdf (new OWL 2 model)
* EuropeanCancerModel-v02.html (redeable web glossary)
* Cancer Model Glossary-v02.xlsx (Excel Glossary)

A Python program was created (with Claude) to transform the OWL2 file into PlantUML (EUCM-v02.puml)
